When and why do we need lazy()?

When our projects goes to large application , if we didn't use lazy our web app become slower and not user friendly! That time we can 
use lazy loading to improve the web app and by adding code splitiing!

What is suspense?

suspense is used in the lazy loading to show the page if the file needs time to load!

allows you to postpone rendering until the data is available, enhancing user experience by offering fallback content or loading indications


Why we got this error : A component suspended while responding to
synchronous input. This will cause the UI to be replaced with a loading indicator.
To fix, updates that suspend should be wrapped with startTransition? How does
suspense fix this error?


It manages asynchronus data , allows you to postone rendering untill data is available!
it make user experience by offering fallback content!


Advantages and disadvantages of using this code splitting pattern?


Advantages ----- faster initial loading time, lower memory usage, better user experience, and a smaller app size

disadvantages ----increased complexity in development and testing processes, more network requests that can affect performance, 


When do we and why do we need suspense?


we need suspense to offering a load by fallback by suspend!
we need to use suspense when we using the lazy loading in our app!
